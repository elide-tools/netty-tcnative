/*
 * NETTY_JNI_ALIAS — emit a JNI-spec entry symbol Java_<class>_<method> as an
 * alias for an existing internal C function.
 *
 * This is used in the static-archive build path (gated by NETTY_BUILD_STATIC;
 * this header is only pulled in under that gate) to expose JNI methods at
 * default visibility for a JVM that resolves them via dlsym on the program
 * image.
 *
 * Implementation note: Clang on Mach-O does NOT support __attribute__((alias))
 * (it errors with "aliases are not supported on darwin"). To stay portable
 * across ELF (Linux/BSD) and Mach-O (macOS) we emit the alias as an assembler
 * directive at file scope: `.globl <Java_*>` exports the new symbol and
 * `.set <Java_*>, <internal_fn>` makes it equivalent to the existing target.
 * Both forms are accepted by GNU as and Apple's as. The leading underscore
 * required for Mach-O symbol names (and absent on ELF) is handled by the
 * NETTY_JNI_SYMBOL_PREFIX macro.
 *
 * Arguments:
 *   java_class  — Fully qualified Java class with '_' separators
 *                 (e.g. io_netty_internal_tcnative_SSL).
 *   method      — Bare method name (e.g. newSSL).
 *   internal_fn — Existing C function name (e.g. netty_internal_tcnative_SSL_newSSL).
